---

## 🚀 Getting Started with the Project
To experience this project, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the `snow_main.py` file.
2. Load a dataset from the `dataset` folder, or alternatively, you can use your own dataset.

> 📂 **Important Note**:  
> Do not delete the `Sorted Data` folder within the dataset directory.

## 🗂️ **Model Files:**
- Files with the extension `.pt` and a **"detect"** in their name are dedicated to detection models.
- Files with the extension `.pt` and a **"segment"** in their name are intended for segmentation models.
